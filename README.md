## Bet Generator 🍀
This algorithm I made randomly selects 6 numbers from 1 to 60 for anyone who wants to play the Mega Sena lottery!

## Explanation

First of all, I am very happy and motivated because this is my first project that I uploaded to GitHub!

In this program, I decided to have some fun with the Tkinter library, which is standard in Python. I created a simple but humble graphical interface 😊. I am accepting contributions because I want to learn more about this library and occasionally make my code more presentable. Thank you! ❤
